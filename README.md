myscheduler
===========

A personal calendar application build with AngularJS, Boostrap 3, angular-ui-calender and the Arshaw FullCalendar control
Scheduled events can be added by dragging external (draggable) events onto the calendar control. Scheduled events can be removed from the calendar by clicking on the them and they can be saved by pressing the "Save Scheduled Events" button. Both scheduled and external (draggable) events are saved in the local store. If you require events to be saved using a REST service, use the commented code in the selectable_events.js and scheduled_events.js services.

If you intend to use "My Scheduler" in a public accessible network e.g. internet, you will need to implement security provisions, which should include login functionality.
